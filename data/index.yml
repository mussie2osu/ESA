biography:
  - text: |
      I am an assistant professor in the computer science and engineering department at the Ohio State University. I am broadly interested in designing intelligent
      data-driven algorithms for current and emerging networking and distributed systems. In particular, I am interested in fundamental questions at the networking 
      layer of blockchains and emerging large scale decentralized applications. I enjoy problems that warrant 'first-principles' thinking. Some of the other topics 
      I have worked on in the past include scheduling algorithms for data center networks, peer-to-peer networks and information theory.

      Prior to my current position I was a postdoc in the networks and mobile systems group at MIT, where I worked on exciting problems in the intersection of network systems,
      algorithms and theory. I received my PhD from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2017. I did my bachelor's degree at the Indian Institute of 
      Technology Madras in 2012. During the summer of 2016 I interned at Google, where I worked on congestion control in Google's data center networks. 
      I was a recipient of the Joan and Lalit Bahl fellowship at UIUC.

      Prospective Graduate Students: I am looking for motivated students interested in blockchains, networking systems and/or machine learning 
      (particularly reinforcement learning). If you are interested, please send me an email.
