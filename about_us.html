        <h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Mission Statement:</h2>

<p>The purpose of ESA is to meet Eritrean students' educational, social, and cultural needs at The Ohio State University and in the greater Columbus area. It is also to advance unity and cooperation amongst all Eritreans and to serve as a worthwhile institution for the Eritrean community in Columbus. ESA’s pillars are <strong><em>community outreach, education, and fundraising. </em></strong> 
</p>

<h2>Founding:</h2>

<p><img src= "images/founders-home.jpg" class = "float">The Eritrean Student Association at The Ohio State University was officially founded in March 2023 by 5 Eritrean students with a collective vision to create a space where Eritrean identity could thrive on campus. It started with the realization that there was a cultural gap on campus, one that needed to be filled with purpose, impact, and identity.</p>

<p>From our very first interest meeting to hosting larger events, we’ve grown tremendously throughout the years. ESA was built on passion, collaboration, and the belief that our culture deserves to be celebrated loudly, boldly, and unapologetically. We are just getting started, but our impact is generational.</p>

<h2>Our Pillars in Action</h2>

<ul>
    <li><em> CCommunity Outreach </em>– We are a pillar in Columbus’ Eritrean community by involving highschool and collegiate level youth, building partnerships with other African organizations at OSU, and having a strong presence on and off campus by being involved at African Night, the Eritrean Festival, Columbus Africa Day, and collabing with other ESA’s across the country. </li>
    <li> <a href="https://mussie2osu.github.io/ESA/philantrophy_projects.html"><em>Philanthropy Projects</em></a> - We fundraise with purpose. Whether it's giving back to underprivileged Eritreans back home, supporting our signature events, or building a scholarship, ESA’s fundraising is rooted in impact. Every dollar raised helps us elevate our organization and empower our members by keeping Eritrean culture alive and thriving at OSU. We're not just raising money, we're making impact. </li>
    <li><em> Education </em>- We create events where members can benefit from panels with professionals, financial literacy workshops, university resources, college nights for highshcool seniors and OSU freshmen, Eritrean history, and real-talk discussions about identity, mental health, and the immigrant experience. 

</ul>
