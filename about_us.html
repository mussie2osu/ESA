        <h1 id="about-us">About Us</h1>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>

<p>The purpose of ESA is to meet Eritrean students' educational, social, and cultural needs at The Ohio State University and in the greater Columbus area. It is also to advance unity and cooperation amongst all Eritreans and to serve as a worthwhile institution for the Eritrean community in Columbus. ESA’s pillars are community outreach, education, and fundraising.</p>

<h2 id="founding">Founding:</h2>

<p>The Eritrean Student Association at The Ohio State University was officially founded in March 2023 by 5 Eritrean students with a collective vision to create a space where Eritrean identity could thrive on campus. It started with the realization that there was a cultural gap on campus, one that needed to be filled with purpose, impact, and identity.</p>

<p>From our very first interest meeting to hosting larger events, we’ve grown tremendously throughout the years. ESA was built on passion, collaboration, and the belief that our culture deserves to be celebrated loudly, boldly, and unapologetically. We are just getting started, but our impact is generational.</p>
